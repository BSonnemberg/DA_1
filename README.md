### Water Reservoir (WR)
Graph nodes that provide water to the entire network. Maximum capacity of < X m^3/sec. Connected to Pumping Stations (PS) by pipelines of maximum capacity of Y m^3/sec.
### Pumping Stations (PS)
Graph nodes that direct or redirect water flow from other PS or WR to the costumers or DS.
### Delivery Sites (DS)
Graph nodes directly connect the water supply to the costumer. It has a specific rate demand of Z m^3/sec.
